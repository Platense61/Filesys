Try:

 ./userfs -reformat 200000 foo
 ./userfs foo

The makefile has been adjusted to compile with c99

I have not added any new functions into the skeleton.

Some notes on the current state of my USERFS: So far I have import export and delete working.
They are a little buggy as you keep on importing deleting and exporting but seems to hold for
the most part. fsck is not implemented yet.
